####Sample data:
  
  from http://citibikenyc.com/stations/json
  { "id"=>72, 
    "stationName"=>"W 52 St & 11 Ave", 
    "availableDocks"=>30, 
    "totalDocks"=>39, 
    "latitude"=>40.76727216, 
    "longitude"=>-73.99392888,

####Application Workflow:

User index page/form
  insert current location
  insert destination
  insert trip length in minutes (15,30,45)

Post request to users_controller
  pass current to geocoder for google
  pass destination to geocoder for google 

Show page
  nearest station to their location
  estimate of available bike at current location
  nearesr station to their destination
